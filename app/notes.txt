What is a component?
- export everything from the component
Why is a container with in a component with it's own index and styles?

Why React?
- Developers work with a virtual browser that is more friendly than the real browser

- React also handles if the user does this show this interface followup
- React Native is a framework while React is a javaScript library you can use for websites 
- React-Native doesn't render html they map to actual iOS and Andriod UI components

Notes from Week 2 Session
- The React Native components build out in native code
- However the business logic is ran in javaScript
- The developer that used the BackgroundImage component used the resize prop and gave it a value (they knew how to use it) because they read the documentation
 - [Image Background Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/imagebackground)
